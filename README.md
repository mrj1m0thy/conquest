COMP-345 Conquest Game
/*
(Marek)Map:
This part of the project will include generating the map as well as making the connections between the
continents. 
Marek had a good idea for the mapping which has to do with numbers representing different kinds of terrain
basically so that we might have to possibility of a randomly generated map. Seems like it would be something
suited for him.

(Tyler, ?)Game Driver:
This part will take 2 people seeing as it is probably biggest... i think. Feel free to contribute.
This section is split into the following:
Startup Phase:

Game Phase:
	-Reinforcement Phase:
		During this phase you can place down more "armies". The amount you can place is based on the
		amount of territories you own. You take that number and divide by 3 and ignore fractions. If the
		result is lower than 3 it is automatically rounded up to 3. You can gain additional "armies" to 
		place if you have control of an entire continent which would give you an additional "army" per turn
		or if you have a set of risk cards you can trade them in for "armies". The first set you trade in
		gives you 4 "armies" and each subsequent set will increase that amount by 2 until the sixth set which will
		be 3 more, then from there the amount increases by 5. (Pretty dumb but they wanted a nice multiple of 5..)
	-Attack Phase:
		Kinda self explanatory, but yes you "attack". (too hard to explain: http://www.hasbro.com/common/instruct/risk.pdf )
		***I will try to finish this so we can use it as a reference when coding
	-Fortification Phase:

Battle:
