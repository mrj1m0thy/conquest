Game Driver by Tyler Lauzon

Thought process:
First thing is first, a general idea of the process that the game driver needs has been given so
all thats needs to be done is for it to be converted to code.
The functions were written down for each phase, then from there it was seeing how they were
going to be linked together and what kind of information will be passed back and forth.
The design of the driver was inspired simply from the phases and their ordering. I was aiming
for a simple yet sturdy base to the upcoming project.
Game rules:
The rules for the driver are simple. Each player gets his/her turn to go through all the phases of the game.
Each player has their chance to place new units at the beginning of his/her turn followed by
an attack on adjacent countries. Then finally they can move their units around to fortify certain positions.

Players however will not be given any individual benefits unless they are earned (posession of
a continent or Risk card) in order to keep the games equal for all.
